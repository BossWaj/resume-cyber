            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Projects Worked on Outside My Day to Day Responsibilities:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Helped the company save costs by reverse engineering a outsourced task and developing an in-house
                solution with additional funtionality. The solution was to generate audit reports inhouse and send out
                automated alerts to client if the load jobs had a few abnormal inserted/updated numbers. This used to be
                done completely manually while using a third party solution who used to generate the report for us.
              </li>
              <li>
                Coded an entire python script to convert data pulled from an API into an CSV file which
                is later fed into an batch script for further processing and finally loades the core tables.
                Since Snaplogic could not be used effectively for this implementation I was given the
                opportunity to work on this project and I had successfully implemented the requirements
                with very quick execution times thanks to multi threading.
              </li>
              <li>
                Automated a recursive and once in month process where we had to parse multiple input files
                and provide the output to the client who were situated in the United States. Since I work
                in the Indian office, from the time of creation of the ticket to the client getting the parsed
                files it would take about 24 hours.
                <p></p>
                But I was able to write a python automation code that helped the client to run the
                code and parse the files themselves - This helped save countless hours. The program
                only took about 5-8 mins to parse 5 files - 200MB each. In this way, I was able improve
                the efficiency of an existing process followed in our team.
